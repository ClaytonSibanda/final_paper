\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Prominent network measurement tools}
There are a number of network measurement software
that are currently deployed to monitor and observe patterns in different networks.
\paragraph{}
The first one that we discuss is PerfSONAR(Performance focused
Service Oriented Network monitoring ARchitecture)\cite{10.1007/11596141_19}. This is a service infrastructure that is web based and is used to collect and publish network performance monitoring\cite{article2}. Its main goal is to make it easy to handle end-to-end performance problems on paths going through several networks \cite{article2}. It does this by using a set of services to deliver performance measurements to an agreed upon network environment.

\paragraph{}
LiveLab is a method used to measure smartphone usage in the field and to measure wireless networks through smartphone users\cite{article3}. This platform employs a tool that is custom built for Iphones only to enable researchers to track users in the field. LiveLab also provides a comprehensive in-device logging of smartphone usage and measurement of wireless
networks\cite{article3}.The tool takes advantage of the mobility
of users and the ability of smartphones to switch connections between multiple routers and that way researchers are able to gain large amounts of data\cite{article3}.

\paragraph{}
RIPE ATLAS is also another tool used extensively
to measure network performance. It uses thousands of
distributed probes and anchors as measurement devices.
The tool can perform IPv4 and IPv6 traceroute, ping,
DNS, NTP\cite{7076582}.
\paragraph{}
PlanetLab is a measurement platform used for testing of new network services. However PlanetLab is rather unusable due to unpredictable load issues and tendency of nodes to be located in a national research network\cite{7076582}.
PeerMetric is a measurement tool used to measure P2P network performance experienced by broadband hosts\cite{7076582}.
\paragraph{}
Mobiperf is an android based application that is used to collect mobile network measurements. On the backend it uses a data collection server to collect and aggregate data. The app periodically checks in with the measurement server which sends it a list of measurement tasks to perform. These measurement tasks include ping, traceroute, HTTP GET, DNS lookup, TCP Throughput, IPv4/v6 compatibility check and UDP Burst. Each task is given a respective set of measurement parameters.
